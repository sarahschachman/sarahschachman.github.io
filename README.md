## Overview

#### Motivation

My page is made for potential employers or my biggest fans :) I want to show a few pictures, what kind of experience I have, and show some projects. Probably just for fun.

#### Content

It will have:
-links to some of my projects
-contact info
-social media links
-an about me page
-a resume section

## Design

I want it to be minimalist but with bright colors and smooth transitions.

## Code

Using HTML and CSS, with jquery and Bootstrap.

				<div id="paragraphs">
					<p>When people ask me where I'm from, I don't usually tell the truth. That would take too long. Usually I say Montana, but my home is actually all over the globe. I grew up in the military and I never would have had it any other way. I have one little brother, David, who is awesome, and my mom and dad are mostly the opposite of chill but I love them because they are the most intelligent and generous people I know. I was born in Albany, Georgia and currently am from Manhattan, Montana. Now I go to school at Harvard, which is kind of difficult, in a way that makes you scorn sleep for all the time/GPA points it deprives you. I'm just kidding! Harvard is incredible and I still have moments where I can't really believe I go there. I'm in a sorority, which is just like I imagined it from the movies. I'm the Director of Sisterhood in Delta Gamma (who could have made up a better position title?!) and it's quite a fun job. I have also been on Crimson Cheerleading, which I blame for my affinity for football. On the serious side, I study CS and psych, and I'm super involved in Harvard's Women in Computer Science. I was a big part in our inaugural conference (which drew attendees from as far as Edinburgh and Berekely!) and it was pretty legit. Now I'm Education Chair, so I get to run the Girls Who Code program in local schools! Which is fantastic, because I love kids almost as much as I love coffee and puppies. Almost.</p>

					<p>Besides school (when, occasionally, I do things other than studying), I like to dance. Not just in the final clubs (shoutout to the Owl Club), but also in Harvard's biggest show of the year, Ghungroo (shoutout to my desi girls). I also country swing dance back home in Montana. If you don't know what that is, <a href="http://youtu.be/wY6V38eYVB0">it's pretty badass</a>. And Montana is gorgeous -- one of my favorite things to do here is go hiking and have a picnic on a mountain somewhere. As long as there's no cliffs, mountain lions, or bears, of course. I also like to read in my spare time (spare time?!). My favorites include The Book Thief, Code Name Verity, Harry Potter, The Importance of Being Earnest, Shadow of the Wind, and anything by John Green (he just gets me). I like beautiful language and I love to learn. That's why all of my inspirational ladies on this sidebar here are both stunning and studious, and never afraid to follow their dreams! Well, that was clich√©. I think that's everything interesting about me. It's been swell! <a href="http://facebook.com/sarah.schachman">Hit me up.</a> </p>

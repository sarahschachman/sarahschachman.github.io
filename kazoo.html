            <h6><strong>Overview</strong></h6>
            <p class="alttitle">July 2014</p>
            <p>Kazoo is a family-friendly, goal-based social platform that motivates kids to get out from behind the screen. Kids ages 8 to 18 spend an average of 7.5 hours behind a screen each day. That’s over 114 full days a year, and only includes entertainment use. Even more time is spent for homework and educational purposes. And as technology becomes a bigger part of our everyday lives, this number is increasing. There are many negative effects of spending too much time behind a screen. According to the NIH, excessive “screen-time” can lead to problems sleeping, anxiety, and increased risk of childhood obesity. Our app, Kazoo, is designed to use a kid’s love of technology to combat this growing issue.</p>
            
            <h6><strong>How it works</strong></h6>
            <p>Kazoo has many features to help kids and parents benefit the most from the app. To start, a new user can sign up as either a parent or child. Depending on which type of user they are, they will have different capabilities. 
            <ul>
            	<li>Goals: Parents can set specific goals for each of their children, which will show up on both the parent's and the child's dashboard. For example, a goal could be to play basketball for 5 hours, or to finish a book.</li>
            	<li>Prizes: There are rewards to incentivize the child to complete the goal, such as going to go see a movie or buy a new book. When a child finishes their goal, it will notify the parent and the parent must approve it.</li>
            	<li>Track progress: Both parent and child's dashboard feature a list of current goals and how far along they are in each, allowing them to be up-to-date on their progress.</li>
            	<li>Friends: Kazoo users can friend other users and view their goals, creating a competitive atmosphere and a social platform aimed at young kids. However, only kids can friend kids, and only parents can friend parents -- safety first!</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

          <h6><strong>Deliverable</strong></h6>
            <p>This is a web app I made with a friend, Allie, as a final project for a Ruby on Rails course. We made this in about 2 weeks, from conecption to demo day. She focused on the back end and database integration, which I focused on front-end and design. At the end of the course, we presented our functioning app.</p> 
          	<h6><strong>Competitive Analysis</strong></h6>
            <p>First we wanted to make sure we weren't repeating an already-existing product, so we scoured the internet for similar services. Most alternatives are mainly for limiting your child’s screen time, versus motivating them to get off and making it fun and interactive. Our app is better because it doesn’t just kick kids off of their computer, iPad, or other electronic device. Instead, it motivates them to get outside, read a book, or hang out with friends.</p>

      	<h6><strong>Use Cases / User Stories</strong></h6>
      	<ul>
      		<li>Helen has one 9 year-old kid, Jacob, who doesn’t get outside much since he quit soccer last year, but she wants to make sure he stays active and healthy. She doesn’t have much information about how to do that, but hopes to learn what she can do through Kazoo. She has tried to get him to sign up for soccer again but nothing seems to motivate him to get out on the field. She doesn’t really know much about the health risks of excessive computer use or raising an elementary school kid. After Helen creates an account with Kazoo, she is brought to her home page which has suggested goals for her child. She reads through the suggested goals, each of which have an accompanying article to help her understand the importance of that activity for Jacob. She easily selects one of the suggested goals, fills out the specifics for her son, and sends it to him.</li>
      		<li>Steven is a dad with two kids. He knows that his kids spend too much time using electronics and is having a hard time motivating them to spend time doing other activities. He’s looking for a kid-friendly platform to motivate his kids without him nagging. The kids love to play with their friends, so he thinks that a social application will appeal to them. Steven logs back into account and sees the progress that each of his kids are making on their currently uncompleted goals. He clicks into each one to refresh his memory of the details and approve of his kids’ most recent submissions. He then checks his messages to find that another parent across town has suggested that they organize a playdate for their kids. Steven replies and him and his kids end up playing basketball the following afternoon.</li>
      		<li>Molly is an 8 year old girl who loves her new iPad. She’s stopped spending as much time outside and with her friends. Her parents made her sign up for Kazoo, and she’s not super thrilled about it because she just wants to play on her iPad. Molly loved that she got to use her new iPad to fill out her personal profile, and she liked picking her own avatar to represent her throughout the site. She found that some of her other friends had profiles also. She looked at their goals and saw how much they had completed and became more motivated to complete her own, so she challenged her friend to a reading contest. Then, Molly looked at the goals her parents had set for her, along with the corresponding point values and potential rewards, and saw that she could earn a trip to the mall, a new iPad app, or a later bedtime if she rode her bike for 30 minutes every day for a week. She shut off her iPad and got on her bike. When she got back, she submitted her progress for her mom to validate.</li>

       <h6><strong>Next Steps</strong></h6>
				<p>Had we more time for the project, here are a few things we would have loved to implement:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>An official way to “challenge” a friend to see who can complete their goal first.</li>
					<li>A way for parents to contact other parents and create “play-dates” or gatherings for their kids to encourage group activities.</li>
					<li>A location-based search feature to find other users in your neighborhood or area.</li>
					<li>We have a welcome email feature that sends some information to parents, but we want to include a learning module with more comprehensive information for parents so they understand why their kids need to stay active and not just spend all of their time behind the computer or tv screen.</li>

            <h6><strong>Overview</strong></h6>
            <p class="alttitle">Currently in progress! Sept 4 - now</p>
            <p>The Innovator’s Practice is a Harvard course aimed at breaking down the process of human centered design and creating opportunities for real-world experience. I am working in a group with three other students from both the college and the Graduate School of Design, and have chosen to focus on the shopping experience in fashion.  We found a common interest in fashion and decided to see what pain points we could uncover in the shopping process, whether that be in-store, online, or through a subscription service. We wanted to see what the motivations were behind choosing one channel over the other, and how the channel affected the shopper’s experience. Our hope going into the project was to get to the core of the shopping experience and uncover what it was missing, and where we might be able to innovate and redefine retail.</p>
          
          	<h6><strong>Deliverable</strong></h6>
            <p>By the end of the semester, I aim to have a product prototype, or a proof-of-concept that can be pitched. At this point in the semester, we are just now moving on from our contextual immersion research and into our solution ideation phase. I will update this page as we make progress!</p>          	           	           	
            
            <h6><strong>Contextual Immersion</strong></h6>
            <p>The first step in our process is to gain a better understanding of the shopping scene. These are the questions we wanted to answer during our preliminary research:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li>What are some different styles of shopping? (e.g., people who browse, people who only shop online, people who impulse buy, etc.)</li>
            	<li>What types of situations affect how people shop?</li>
            	<li>How do different points of entry affect the subsequent shopping experience? How do people act differently?</li>
            	<li>How do the shoppers’ underlying goals differ between shopping styles? And how do they differ between point of entry?</li>
            	<li>What are some situations that people find frustrating? How do these frustrations differ by persona?</li>
            	<li>How do those pain points differ by shopping style?</li>
            	<li>What are some shopping alternatives / technologies currently in use? (e.g. personal shoppers, eBay, The Hunt, Birchbox, etc.) What issues to they address?</li>
            	<li>How do people decide where to shop? How do they discover items they like, and find what they need efficiently?</li>

            </ul>
            
            <h6><strong>Key Quotes</strong></h6>
            
            <p>With these broad questions we set out into the square to start talking to people in real-life shopping situations, to get the most accurate read on the shopping process. We aimed to talk to a diverse bunch of shoppers while still staying within our target demographic of 18-30 years old.  We even ended up talking to a few of the store clerks and owners to see if they had any insights coming from the opposite perspective of the shopping experience. Here are a few key excerpts from our discussions:</p>
            
            <ul>
            	<li>“Increased traffic online increases traffic in-store” - owner of J Press</li>
            	<li>"Most people know what they want coming in, but obviously can’t get fitted online” - owner of J Press</li>
            	<li>“People reference what they see online ~15% of the time” - store clerk at the Gap</li>
            	<li>“I online shop at stores I already know my size in” - girl shopping at the Gap</li>
            	<li>“Lots of customers come in asking questions about specific shoes or brands. You can’t introduce a second option when they come in looking for something specific, because then they will doubt themselves and have to sleep on it” - manager of the Tannery</li>
            	<li>“They came to look around, but I’m getting bored…” - young male in Urban Outfitters with a few friends</li>
            	<li>"If I am with a friend that I consider fashionable, I will often check out new brands that they like/recommend.” - college-aged female</li>
            	<li>"I look for reviews across multiple websites - i.e. so i know they are not too biased to customers that love a brand/site. I look for reviews from people that are similar to me” - college-aged female</li>
            </ul>
            
<!--
            <p>We also made note of a few key points of entry for shopping:</p>
            
            <ul>
            
									<li>marketing email</li>
									<li>researching a specific product</li>
									<li>Facebook or Amazon recommendation</li>
									<li>procrastination browsing</li>
									<li>friend recommendation</li>
							
           				<li>window shopping</li>
           
           				<li>looking to try on something specific</li>

           				<li>coupon to use in-store</li>
           			
            </ul>
-->
            
            <h6><strong>Conclusions from Immersion</strong></h6>
		
            
            <p>Here are a few revelations that stood out from our research:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li>Having a good in-store and post-purchase experience is very important as it leads to repeat customers</li>
            	<li>Shopping with others is only positive if you want to invite others’ opinions - otherwise, it’s just seen as a nuisance and a drain on time</li>
            	<li>Personal reviews from our trust networks are very persuasive</li>
            	<li>People assign specific purposes to certain stores so that they can make quick decisions on where to go when they need something</li>
            </ul>
            
            
            
            
            
            <h6><strong>Defining our personas and user journeys</strong></h6>
        		<p>A few main personalities and shopping styles emerged from our user interviews and immersion, which exemplify the main types of shoppers in our demographic. These personas don’t represent every person, of course — most people are a mix of traits from different personas. However, these personas all have very different attitudes and different approaches to shopping. Because of these distinct approaches, we thought that creating user journeys for each persona would help us uncover some possible pain points in the journey. Here are the three personas we came up with:</p>
          	
          		<p class="alttitle">The Fashion Connoisseur</p>	
          		<p>Gwen is a fashion expert. She’s very invested in looking good and keeping up with the latest trends. She tends to browse and window shop, and she’s super trendy. She is confident in her personal style and tends to shop alone.</p>

		<p class="alttitle">The Get-it-done Shopper</p>
		<p>Jack is no longer a novice, and he’s invested in his appearance. He is extremely efficient because he’s short on time, and he is traditional because he sticks to what he knows. He is confident in his style and tends to shop alone.</p>

				<div class=wrapper-small>
		<p class="alttitle">The Hands-off Novice</p>
		<p>Cecily is a novice shopper, minimally invested in fashion, tends to be efficient but can also browse when something catches her eye. She aims to be trendy, but indecisive and a social shopper, bringing lots of friends along for extra opinions.</p>

       <h6><strong>Innovation Focus</strong></h6>
				<p>Based upon the pain points we identified during our research, and some patterns we noticed during the creation of the personas and journeys, we decided to focus on the problem of discovery and personalization. We found that these issues were consistent throughout all of our personas, no matter their experience level, commitment level, or financial level. The question of “Where can I find the perfect piece for me?” combines the ideas of personalization and discovery, and it is a question that gets at the underlying goal of most shoppers, no matter their point of entry or shopping style. They want to find pieces that are an accurate representation of their fashion sense, and also know where to find them. Going forward, our focus will be on these aspects of the shopping experience, and we hope to formulate an idea for innovation in this area.</p>

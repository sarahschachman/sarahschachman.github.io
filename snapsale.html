            <h6><strong>Overview</strong></h6>
            <p class="alttitle">August 27-28th, 2015</p>
            <p>Snapsale is a fun way to discover new stores and products while saving ridiculous amounts of money. If you see something you like, you have to hurry, because it’ll be gone in a flash — once the picture disappears the deal is gone. It’s the impulse buyer’s dream. Basically, Snapsale is Snapchat for flash sales.
<br><br>
Snapsale is an idea we came up with for Hackdays, Shopify’s quarterly hackathon. We wanted to take advantage of Shopify’s capabilities by having it integrate into the Shopify admin. This would make it easy for merchants to use Snapsale with their pre-existing stores and create Snapsales with almost zero effort.</p>

            <h6><strong>The Problem</strong></h6>
            <p>From a shopper’s point of view, flash sales are pretty awesome, but who likes opening an email about a sale for their favorite store… 1 hour after it’s ended? And as a merchant, planning for them is tedious — as a customer, waiting around for them isn’t too fun either. We saw an opportunity to game-ify flash sales to make them more fun and easy for both merchants and customers.</p>
            
            
            <h6><strong>Constraints</strong></h6>
            <p>With less than two days to come up with an idea and build a polished, presentable proof of concept, we needed to move fast. This was made even more difficult by the fact that we needed to build something in React Native, which was new to all 4 of the developers on my team. Also, with such an intense time constraint, we couldn’t spend too much time on research and ideation. We needed to iron out a solid idea and wireframe the user flow so that the developers could start coding immediately. If we had more time, we could have spent it on doing user research on our target audience, and testing out prototypes to find the kinks in our design. Unfortunately, we needed to lock down the basic flow early on, so only 25% of my time was spent on defining the user experience, and the rest was on designing the branding and UI.</p>

            <h6><strong>Designing the User Experience</strong></h6>
            <p class="alttitle">Merchant perspective</p>
            <p>If I am a merchant who wants to reach more impulse-buy customers through the Snapsale app, all I need to do is go to the Shopify app store to integrate it into my store admin. Now in my admin I will have a Snapsale page, which shows me any current Snapsales I may have running, along with any past sales. Both current sales and past sales will show me interesting statistics, including how much time left (for current sales), my stock level, how many people have opened the snapsale, and how much money earned from the sale. When making a new sale, I simply decide the product I want to use (making sure my stock is high enough), and then I decide the sale price and the amount of time I want it to be available (default is 24 hours).</p>
            <p class="alttitle">Customer perspective</p>
            <p>If I am a customer who wants to discover new products and amazing deals, then all I have to do is download Snapsale and wait for merchants to send out sales. The app needs to be fun and simple to use so that customers are delighted when they discover a great deal on a cool product, and feel rewarded when they make a purchase. There’s no required login or forms until you make a purchase, so users can see the value of the app and become invested before the app presents them with the entering-information obstacle. When a merchant sends out a snapsale, it shows up on my home screen showing which store it is from and how much time I have left to open it (usually 24 hours, but it can be however long the merchant wants the flash sale to be available). When I open a snapsale, I see a photo of the product, its price (including how much I’m saving). I have 60 seconds to make a decision, with the time counting down in the corner. If I want to learn more, I can click on the info button, which will pause the timer. There I can read the product description, the store name, and see available product options (e.g. size or color). If I don’t want to buy it, I can dismiss it and it disappears from my home screen. Otherwise, I can click the buy button. If this is my first time making a purchase, it will ask me for my payment and shipping info. Now it will be saved, so I don’t have to do it again. However, I can always edit this in my profile. Now there is a success message which tells me that my product is on its way, and the day it is going to arrive. Yay! Impulse buying and product discovery made fun and easy. (Almost too easy?)</p>
            <p class="alttitle">The Process</p>
            <p>To design these flows, I thought about job stories, or objectives that they each needed to accomplish, and broke those larger goals down into finite steps. I brainstormed screens that could facilitate this flow of actions and make sense going from step to step.</p>

            <h6><strong>Designing the branding and UI</strong></h6>
            <p>I wanted Snapsale’s visual identity to convey the feeling of excitement, playfulness, speed, and joy. It needed to be clean and focused, with minimal distractions and only a few actions on each page. Each page needed to have a clear purpose, with a consistency between pages.</p>
            <p class="alttitle">The Process</p>
            <p>From my wireframes, I went straight into high-fidelity mockups in Sketch (due to the time constraint of the project).</p>

					<li class="has-animation" data-delay="200"><a href="files/uploads/snapsaledetail3.png" data-rel="lightcase"><img src="files/uploads/snapsaledetail3.png" alt="snapsale detail"/></a></li>

    <div class="wrapper-small">       
            <h6><strong>Scalability</strong></h6>
            <p>Currently, customers would receive snapsales from all stores that send them out. However, once Snapsale grows, we don’t want to overwhelm customers with a barrage of sales of things that may not remotely interest them. To fix this, stores could be broken down into genres (women’s clothing, men’s sportswear, jewelry, etc.) and customers could follow whatever genres they are interested in. Another option is a learning algorithm, which shows snapsales to users most likely to buy them based on past purchases.</p>
            
            <h6><strong>Next steps</strong></h6>
            <p>If I had more time, I would have loved to make a working prototype in Principle or Flinto, because I think a lot of the fun of interacting with the app will be in its subtle but delightful animations. For example, when a customer makes a purchase, a joyful animation (along with fun copy), would create a subconscious emotional reward.<br><br>

Another thing to design would be the onboarding, or the first-time-user experience. How do we show the value app quickly to new users? How do they learn the flow of the app? How do we lead them to their first purchase and get them hooked?<br><br>

The more obvious next step, of course, is actually building both the mobile app and its integration with Shopify. To be continued!</p>
